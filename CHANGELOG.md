## [Unreleased]

### Fixed
- **PID autotune `negative_output` on heat-only loop** — the autotune button previously used `negative_output: -1.0`, but the temperature PID has no `cool_output`. With no cooling actuator the `-1.0` level goes nowhere, making the relay-feedback oscillation asymmetric and the resulting gains unreliable. Changed to `negative_output: 0.0` so the test correctly oscillates between "heater full on" and "heater off (passive cool-down)". Updated `docs/pid-tuning.md` with heat-only timing expectations (60–120 min) and a recommendation to prefer manual tuning.

### Added
- **Clear Sensor Condensation button now works** — the button previously only logged a message. It now pulses the SHT45 on-chip heater for one measurement cycle to evaporate condensation: `set_heater_max_duty(1.0)` → force update → 1.5 s wait → `set_heater_max_duty(0.0)` → force clean reading. Added `id: sht45` to the SHT45 platform block to enable on-demand component calls.
- **Cross-platform setup instructions** — `README.md` and `docs/setup.md` now give both Linux/macOS and Windows (PowerShell) commands for creating a venv, installing the pinned ESPHome, copying `secrets.yaml`, and generating the API key. `CLAUDE.md` notes the Windows `py -m esphome` / `Copy-Item` equivalents.

### Changed
- **Docs sweep / accuracy pass** across every document:
  - `docs/setup.md` now installs ESPHome via the pinned `requirements.txt` (was bare `pip install esphome`), matching CI.
  - `docs/cure-programs.md` corrected the VPD Hysteresis default to **0.1 kPa** (config value; doc previously said 0.2) and added the 0.8 kPa VPD Setpoint default.
  - `docs/hardware.md` removed a stale "dehumidifier exhaust" mention (no dehumidifier in this build) and fixed the fusing example to match the 300 W / 25 A BOM PSU.
  - `docs/pid-tuning.md` documents the heat-only autotune caveat (`negative_output: -1.0` with no `cool_output`).
  - `docs/display-plan.md` / `CLAUDE.md` flag that GPIO10 is claimed by *either* the optional cold-plate DS18B20 *or* the ST7789 TFT DC line, not both.
  - `CLAUDE.md` updated for the grouped web UI (`web_server` sorting groups), the UTF-8 byte-escape convention, diagnostic sensors, and per-program temp targets.

### Fixed
- **Documentation accuracy: Clear Sensor Condensation button** — clarified that the button currently only logs the request and does **not** pulse the SHT45 heater (the `sht4x` platform exposes no on-demand heater action at the pinned ESPHome version). `docs/calibration.md`, `docs/hardware.md`, and `CLAUDE.md` now describe it as a known limitation; tracked in `TODO.md`. No firmware change.
- **Text-sensor states crashing the Home Assistant API connection** — the `°C` glyph in several status strings was written as `\xc2\xb0C`, where C's `\x` escape greedily absorbs the following hex-digit `C`, producing the byte `0x0C` and invalid UTF-8 on the wire. HA's protobuf parser rejected the malformed `TextSensorStateResponse`, throwing a fatal `data_received()` error that dropped and reconnected the API connection in a loop (logged on the device as `CONNECTION_CLOSED errno=128`). Terminated each affected escape with `""` (`\xc2\xb0""C`) — the same workaround already used for the `°F` cases. Affected the `Humidity Control Mode`, `10-Day Program Status`, and `Cannatrol Program Status` text sensors, plus two OLED display strings. Display-only; no behavior change beyond a stable HA connection.

## v1.0.0 — 2026-06-13

First stable release. Major control-loop rework plus a full documentation and UI polish pass.

### Added
- **Control-topology rework** — the Peltier now chases dew point / VPD (cold-plate condensation is the dehumidifier) and the heater chases temperature. The temperature PID is now **heat-only**.
- **10-Day Dry Program** (`10-Day Dry Program` switch) — dew-point recipe: a 2-day ramp 60→57→54 °F DP, hold 54 °F (days 3–6), hold 52 °F (days 7–10), auto-off after day 10. `10-Day Program Day` counter and `10-Day Program Status` text sensor.
- **High-temperature safety ceiling** — `Max Chamber Temperature (Safety Ceiling)` number (default 27 °C / 80 °F). Because the PID is heat-only, this forces the Peltier on above the ceiling so the chamber can't overheat.
- **VPD target mode** — humidity control mode (`VPD Control Mode` switch); `VPD Setpoint` and `VPD Hysteresis` number entities
- **Organized web UI** — entities grouped (Climate & Temperature, Humidity & Dew Point, VPD, Cure Programs, PID Tuning, Hardware & Status, Diagnostics) via `web_server` v3 sorting groups, plus added icons across the board.
- **Peltier Output** and **VPD Error** sensors — exposed so the Home Assistant dashboard renders without missing entities.
- **Docs site polish** — SVG favicon, `display-plan.md` added to the MkDocs nav.
- **Optional cold-plate sensor section** (commented YAML): DS18B20 one-wire on GPIO10 for direct frost detection
- **GitHub Actions CI** — `esphome config` validation runs on every PR that touches `espcure.yaml`; `requirements.txt` added
- **HA dashboard enhancements** — VPD gauge, color-coded overview badges, conditional program progress bars, 7-day temperature history, VPD control section
- **Made for ESPHome compliance** — `esp32_improv` and `improv_serial` components added for BLE + serial WiFi provisioning

### Changed
- **Temperature PID is now heat-only** (`cool_output` removed). Default target raised 55 °F → **60 °F (15.6 °C)** — a realistic floor for Peltier strength. Set to `mode: HEAT` on boot.
- **Peltier is no longer a PID output** — it is bang-bang driven by the 30 s dew-point/VPD loop via `set_level(1.0/0.0)`. New `peltier_cooling` global tracks demand.
- **Frost guard** now forces the **Peltier** off below `min_chamber_temp` (was: suspend whole PID). The heater keeps running during frost to aid recovery.
- **Fan relay** ON when the Peltier is cooling OR the heater is heating; commanded ON in the same lambda as the Peltier so the hot-side fan always has airflow.
- **Peltier and heater outputs** both use `ledc` at 15 Hz (Peltier switched from `slow_pwm`; junction sees average power, reducing fatigue).
- **BOM**: replaced 5 V PSU with a 12 V → 5 V buck converter (e.g. LM2596 or MP1584EN module) — one less power brick.
- **README.md** rewritten to reflect current hardware (ESP32-C6, SHT45, SSR-40 DDs) and current features (OLED, RGB LED, two humidity modes, Cannatrol 4+4 + 10-Day Dry, VPD, CI)
- `cannatrol_day` max_value raised 8 → 9 to accommodate end-of-program day counter
- Removed piezo buzzer (`ledc_output`, `rtttl`, frost/program-complete melodies); GPIO10 is now free
- `docs/display-plan.md` rewritten as an "implemented" reference (OLED live in config); updated GPIO budget to reflect GPIO8/9 assignments
- `docs/setup.md` full rewrite: LED colour table, OLED page guide, 10-step setup, comprehensive first-run checklist
- `docs/hardware.md`: buzzer removed from BOM/GPIO table; OLED wiring section added
- `docs/calibration.md`: removed DS18B20 section (no cold-plate sensor in this build); added humidity salt reference table
- `CLAUDE.md`: added OLED and WS2812 RGB LED to capabilities; added display/LED key-section entries
- `docs/hardware.md`, `docs/cure-programs.md`, `docs/pid-tuning.md`, `docs/ha-dashboard.yaml`, `CLAUDE.md`: updated for the heat-only / Peltier-dehumidification topology, the new 10-Day Dry program, and the safety ceiling

### Removed
- **External dehumidifier relay** (`Dehumidifier` switch, GPIO23) — the Peltier cold plate is now the sole dehumidification mechanism. GPIO23 is free.
- **RH humidity control mode** — `Humidity Setpoint` / `Humidity Hysteresis` numbers, the `Humidity Error` sensor, and the RH bang-bang branch. RH without temperature is unreliable.
- **18-day RH step-down program** — `Cure Program (18-day)` switch, `Cure Program Day` counter, `Cure Program Status` sensor (replaced by the 10-Day Dry program).
- **Apply Cold-Plate Profile** button — it relied on the removed RH fallback.
- **PID Cool Output** diagnostic sensor — the PID no longer has a cool output.
